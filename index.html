      <h2>The Briefing</h2>
      <p>SETF offers financial services to nearly 700,000 retail and lease customers across Southeast Toyota's 177 dealers in Alabama, Florida, Georgia, North Carolina, and South Carolina.</p>
      <p class="p-tp">Its website, SETF.com, enables the organization to market vehicles, promote offers, and service its customers and is the gateway for registered customers to manage their accounts and vehicles, make payments, explore offers and coupons, and get help.</p>
      <p class="p-tp">But the team that had recently inherited the website knew that they could do more to improve the digital experience and improve customer engagement.</p>

      <h2>Challenge</h2>
      <p>The website significantly limited SETF's ability to control the presentation of content and while SETF consistently ranks at the top of its class for consumer financing satisfaction, its website didn't positively extend or enhance the brand, was payment-focused, and offered little value-added content - providing no reason to stay once a payment was made - let alone stay in the driver's seat of a Toyota once their last payment was made.</p>

      <h3>What We Learned</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>The website did not clearly communicate its product offering and services to customers.</li>
        <li>While the primary navigation attempted to emulate the Toyota.com navigation, it did not change to accommodate the needs of unauthenticated visitors and authenticated customers, offering an architecture that was too broad to effectively service either audience well.</li>
        <li>Core concepts within a larger topic are not easily navigable. Exploration of existing content is hindered.</li>
        <li>The search generated duplicate and unexpected results and lacked features to easily refine and sort results.</li>
        <li>In-page messaging and notifications were cold and impersonal, devoid of personality.</li>
        <li>While the website included a handful of features to personalize the experience, these features were underused or didn't function.</li>
        <li>Page layouts were inflexible and inefficiently organized, limiting the organization's ability to make use of precious real estate.</li>
        <li>Content and promotions were generic and did not consider the customer's needs, intentions, or place in the lifecycle.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Strategy</h2>
      <p>The strategy process is supposed to be adaptive, iterative, innovative and collaborative. In an effort to gather valuable information we conducted multiple workshops before moving on to design sprints.</p>

    <div class="c-standard">
      <p>Our research brought us to the following recommendations to implement our solutions and achieve SETF's goals.</p>
      <ul class="p-tp">
        <li>Content on SETF.com should communicate its core benefits to a customer through customer-centric tools.</li>
        <li>There is an opportunity to reorganize the navigation into customer-centric tools and services that map to customers' use cases and pain points.</li>
        <li>Unauthenticated and authenticated states of the website should be wholly distinct.</li>
        <li>The unauthenticated site should educate the potential customer the benefits of registering and working with SETF.</li>
        <li>The authenticated state of the site should provide personalized tools and resources to its customers, while providing core financial tools.</li>
        <li>The navigation should limit its use of dropdowns, instead providing clear customer-centric concepts leading to rich landing page experiences.</li>
        <li>The website should provide a secondary navigation that allows customers to easily explore within a larger topic.</li>
        <li>Search can be enhanced with better categorized content to facilitate customer filtering and sorting. The categorization will also provide opportunities for targeted content marketing to specific users.</li>
        <li>The website's systemic messaging should feel more human and conversational. Small positive interactions will build trust with registered users.</li>
        <li>Limit large images that do not directly tie to the marketing messages.</li>
        <li>Large images should be used sparingly as they easily compete with the site's utility.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="p-tp">Based on our gathered requirements and ideations we began to wireframe our collaborative vision.</p>
      <p class="p-tp">Our initial layouts were focused on the homepage in an unauthenticated state and an authenticated state in the form of a vehicle detail page.</p>
      <p class="p-tp">Our aim was to use the wireframes to communicate our ideas to the client, help them visualize the end result and gather feedback.</p>
